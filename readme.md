Contains a workaround for broken mouses that sometimes send a double-click instead of a single click.
You can fine-tune the minimal delay between two clicks in the user interface, which can be opened by double-clicking the Windows tray icon. 
You can also register the application to launch at Windows startup.

Download the release, unzip and run the executable (you might have to install the .NET runtime first) or compile it yourself.
