# Creating a release
git tag -a v1.0.1.0

git push origin v1.0.1.0

# Next features
- publish in windows store (msix)
- store settings in the correct place (not app.config). This also makes upgrades easier
- show UI at first launch? Or register app for startup automatically (on install?)

# Ideas
- add github link to UI
